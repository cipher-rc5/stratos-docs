## Overview

- Codebase runs on Bun only; use Bun for the runtime and dependency management.
- Changes pushed from the v0.app UI sync automatically into this repository.
- Vercel builds and deploys directly from this repo using Bun.

## Getting Started (Bun)

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

## Deployment

Live app on Vercel:

- https://vercel.com/zerocreativity-systems/v0-untitled-chat-31

## Build in v0.app

- https://v0.app/chat/r5gys55SHsK

## How It Works

1. Build and modify the chat in [v0.app](https://v0.app).
2. Deploy from the v0 interface; changes sync into this repo.
3. Vercel deploys the latest commit using Bun.
